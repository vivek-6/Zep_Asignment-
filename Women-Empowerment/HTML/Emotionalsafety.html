          Emphasis is often placed on planning around physical safety, but do
          not consider their emotional wellbeing when they create a safety plan.
          Emotional safety looks different for different people, but planning
          for your emotional safety is ultimately about developing a
          personalized plan that helps you feel accepting of your emotions and
          decisions when dealing with abuse.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Emotional safety planning will also build resilience to help you deal
          with the impact of abuse. Here are some steps you can take to help
          create and maintain an emotional safety plan that works for you:
        </p>

        <ul type="square" class="box">
          <li>
            <b>Seek out supportive people.</b> A caring presence such as a
            trusted friend or family member can help create a calm atmosphere to
            think through difficult situations and discuss potential options.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Identify and work towards achievable goals.</b>Achievable goals
            can be as simple as calling a local resource to see what services
            are available in your area, or talking to one of our advocates at
            The Hotline. Remember that you don’t have to do anything you aren’t
            comfortable with, but taking small steps can help options feel more
            possible when you’re ready.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Create a peaceful space for yourself.</b> Designating a physical
            place where your mind can relax and feel safe can help you work
            through the difficult emotions that arise when dealing with abuse.
            This can be a room in your house, a spot under your favorite tree, a
            comfy chair by a window, or in a room with low lighting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Remind yourself of your inherent value.</b>You are special and
            important, and recognizing and reminding yourself of this reality is
            important for your emotional health. It’s never your fault when
            someone chooses to be abusive to you, and their actions are no
            reflection of the great value you have as a person.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Remember that you deserve to be kind to yourself.</b>Take time
            every day to practice self-care, even if only for a few minutes, in
            order to establish space for peace and emotional safety in your
            life. It’s healthy and recommended to give yourself breaks from the
            stressors in your life, to the extent that you’re able to. Little
            moments like these can go a long way in helping you think more
            clearly and make informed decisions.

							Domestic violence, or intimate partner violence (IPV) as it is
							sometimes called, is a worldwide problem.[10] Domestic abuse
							includes physical, emotional and sexual violence of any form. In
							India, the PWDVA also includes economic abuse under the definition
							of domestic violence. A 1999 study examined the prevalence and
							characteristics of domestic abuse in five districts of northern
							India during 1995–1996. The study reported that in those five
							districts, lifetime prevalence of domestic abuse ranged from 18%
							to 45%.

							Conservative lawmakers and anti-women's rights supporters still

							wrongful arrests in statutory rape in spite of the high incidence
							of unreported or reported cases of sexual abuse that warrants such
							laws. According to a 2012 United Nations report, 47% of Indian
							women marry younger than 18 (the legal marriage age is 21 for men
							and 18 for women).
