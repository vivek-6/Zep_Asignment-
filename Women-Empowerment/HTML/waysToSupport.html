					Watching someone endure an abusive situation can be difficult under
					any circumstances, and it's not always clear how best to respond when
					you see the <span> warning signs of abuse</span>. Your instinct may be
					to “save them” from the relationship, but abuse is never that simple.
					There are many ways that abuse appears and there are many reasons
					<span> why people stay</span> in abusive situations.
				</p>

				<p>
					Understanding how <span> power and control </span>operate in the
					context of abuse and how to shift power back to those affected by
					domestic violence are some of the most important ways to support
					survivors in your life.
				</p>

				<h1>Emotional Support</h1>
				<p>
					The experience of surviving relationship abuse is traumatic, and
					people in any stage of an abusive relationship should be able to
					depend on others for support as they process complex emotions and
					navigate next steps.
				</p>
				<p>You can provide essential emotional support by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Acknowledging that their situation is difficult, scary, and brave of
						them to regain control from.
					</li>
					<li>
						Not judging their decisions and refusing to criticize them or guilt
						them over a choice they make.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remembering that you cannot “rescue them,” and that decisions about
						their lives are up to them to make.
					</li>
					<li>Not speaking poorly of the abusive partner.</li>
					<li>Helping them <span> create a safety plan</span>.</li>
					<li>
						Continuing to be supportive of them if they do end the relationship
						and are understandably lonely, upset, or return to their abusive
						partner.
					</li>
					<li>
						Offering to go with them to any service provider or legal setting
						for moral support.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>Material Support</h1>
				<p>
					Depending on the situation, a survivor may be financially dependent on
					an abusive partner or otherwise lacking access to material resources.
					One of the most immediate ways you can support someone experiencing
					relationship abuse is by helping them with their material needs.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Help them identify a support network to assist with physical needs
						like housing, food, healthcare, and mobility as applicable.
					</li>
					<li>
						Help them by storing important documents or a “to-go bag” in case of
						an emergency situation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Encourage them to participate in activities outside of their
						relationship with friends and family, and be there to support them
						in such a capacity
					</li>
					<li>
						Encourage them to talk to people who can provide further help and
						guidance, like The Hotline or our teen and young adult project love
						is respect.
					</li>
					<li>
						If they give you permission, help document instances of domestic
						violence in their life, including pictures of injuries, exact
						transcripts of interactions, and notes on a calendar of dates that
						incidents of abuse occur.
					</li>
					<li>
						Don’t post information about them on social media that could be used
						to identify them or where they spend time
					</li>
					<li>
						Help them learn about their formal legal rights through resources
						like <span> Women’s Law</span>, which provides information on
						domestic violence laws and procedures.
					</li>
					<li>
						With their permission, ensure that others in the buildings where the
						survivor lives and works are aware of the situation, including what
						to do (and what not to do) during a moment of crisis or
						confrontation with an abusive partner.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>
					Healing from relationship abuse<span> occurs on many fronts.</span></span>
				</h2>
				<p>
					The more that others are able to take on themselves to support a
					survivor’s healing, the more that person will be able to focus on
					their own growth and processing.

							Domestic violence, or intimate partner violence (IPV) as it is sometimes called, is a worldwide problem.[10] Domestic abuse includes physical, emotional and sexual violence of any form. In India, the PWDVA also includes economic abuse under the definition of domestic violence. A 1999 study examined the prevalence and characteristics of domestic abuse in five districts of northern India during 1995–1996. The study reported that in those five districts, lifetime prevalence of domestic abuse ranged from 18% to 45%.

							Conservative lawmakers and anti-women's rights supporters still claim that the higher age of consent could results in abuses and wrongful arrests in statutory rape in spite of the high incidence of unreported or reported cases of sexual abuse that warrants such laws. According to a 2012 United Nations report, 47% of Indian women marry younger than 18 (the legal marriage age is 21 for men and 18 for women).
