					More than <span> 12 million people in the U.S.</span> are affected by
					domestic violence each year. While domestic violence typically happens
					behind closed doors, in some cases it does happen in a public space or
					around friends or family members, meaning that other people may
					witness or be aware of the abuse. When we overhear or see something
					that doesn’t feel right, it can be difficult to know how to react. So,
					here are some tips and suggestions for what you might do to intervene
					if you witness domestic violence.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you witness domestic violence in public, it’s important to take
					into account your own safety as well as the survivor’s. There is
					safety in numbers, so gathering a group of people to stand nearby and
					either verbally or physically intervene is one option. Contacting the
					authorities is another option. You might even record the incident with
					your phone to pass to law enforcement
					<span> if the survivor chooses to press charges </span> (keep in mind,
					however, that some survivors choose not to take legal action).
				</p>
				<p>
					If you’re hearing suspicious noises from your neighbors, one option is
					to speak with the survivor in person the next day. You might greet
					them with a question like, ”Hey, I heard some stuff last night. Are
					you okay?” Make sure to approach them in a safe, private space, listen
					to them carefully and believe what they have to say. Never blame them
					or ask what they did to “provoke” their partner. Let them know the
					abuse isn’t their fault, and that they deserve support. You might give
					them The Hotline’s contact information or direct them to a local
					crisis line. If you are ever concerned for the survivor’s immediate
					safety (or your own), you do have the right to contact the police. If
					the survivor decides to press charges against the abusive partner,
					your statement can be one way to help them
					<span>document what they’ve experienced</span>.

				<p>
					Watching someone experience abuse is challenging, especially if that
					person is someone you know and love. Abuse is about
					<span>power and control</span> , meaning there may be a clear
					imbalance in the relationship where one partner has or ends up with
					more power and control over the other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Conversations with a survivor about their situation can be hard: they
					may not want to discuss the abuse they’re experiencing for any number
					of reasons, including fear, shame, or even concern for their partner
					who has abusive behavior.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you’ve noticed <a href="#"> warning signs of abuse </a>affecting
					someone in your life, your instinct may be to intervene or even “save
					them” from the relationship, but it’s never that simple.

				<p>
					Knowing how to have conversations that empower survivors to make their
					own decisions is one of the most important ways you can help someone
					in an abusive relationship reach a safer place.

							Domestic violence, or intimate partner violence (IPV) as it is
							sometimes called, is a worldwide problem.[10] Domestic abuse
							includes physical, emotional and sexual violence of any form. In
							India, the PWDVA also includes economic abuse under the definition
							of domestic violence. A 1999 study examined the prevalence and
							characteristics of domestic abuse in five districts of northern
							India during 1995–1996. The study reported that in those five
							districts, lifetime prevalence of domestic abuse ranged from 18%
							to 45%.

							Conservative lawmakers and anti-women's rights supporters still
							claim that the higher age of consent could results in abuses and
							wrongful arrests in statutory rape in spite of the high incidence
							of unreported or reported cases of sexual abuse that warrants such
							laws. According to a 2012 United Nations report, 47% of Indian
							women marry younger than 18 (the legal marriage age is 21 for men
							and 18 for women).
